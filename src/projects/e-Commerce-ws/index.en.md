We were contacted by K2 Omniverse, a company of entrepreneurs with the mision to create links between celebrities and their massive audiences, with a mission that seemed impossible: Build, in four weeks, an e-commerce platform for Will Smith, that would allow him to offer his millions of followers, during 72 hours only, a new and exclusive collection of products belonging to his then new brand Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.

We successfully accomplished the mission of building a platform based on Shopify and a robust backend capable of adding, in real time, the sales and social media data generated during the period the campaign was active. After that, during more than 2 years, we worked on building different tools that allowed the creative people of the organization to launch different promotions, all of them, based intensely on the use of data that allowed to revolutionize the brand Bel-Air Athletics and position it on the forefront of the industry.

On the development of this platform we used more open-source projects than any other project given the innovative and disruptive nature of our client. We were able to keep this technology and its artifacts under control, complying with our strict integration and continuous delivery processes, and other ones like design systems that allowed us to raise our technology and engineering levels.
