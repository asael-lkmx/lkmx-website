Our client, a specialized logistics company, the country’s third biggest in its field, reached us to help with the analysis and implementation of a system that would allow to gather orders from the more than 900 hospitals all around Mexico of its client, the second biggest government health network in the country. We initially worked 4 months with them exhaustively on the implementation and analysis of a base solution that could be set in motion immediately, and to this day, with an agile maintenance that has allowed to maintain the operation in addition to implementing the changes that are continuously required by the operation and the client itself. 

The solution consists of a cloud-based platform that connects with our client’s existing information systems through REST APIs that orchestrate different processes such as order taking and approval. As well as their placement in an inventory validation wave in which different notifications are sent to the proper players to ensure this flow operates in the most optimal way. In addition, different applications destined for players within the supply chain such as supervisors, carriers, agents and pharmacy employees, that guarantee the traceability of each of the hundreds and thousands of medicines that are sent to the whole country on a monthly basis. 

The application implements an architecture, based on microservices, that makes use of patterns and cloud technology to be highly resilient and secure. The services developed on robust technology like Java, Elasticsearch, Spring Boot, have allowed our client to adapt this platform to any type of need, keeping operational costs to a minimum without compromising its quality and safety.
