A CRM was required to help with efficiently tracing the real estate agencyâ€™s prospects, boosting sales force through tools that help them increase their volume and measure their effectiveness.

A Discovery project was done to understand the project scope and limitations concluding with two viable development options. The chosen solution was comprised of several parts:

- Main flows implementation: An initial version of the main flows was implemented for validation and improvement.
- Digitized documentation: Paper documentation was exchanged for digital, for the closing and ownership transfer, which is shared through the platform avoiding the excessive use of paper.
- Notifications on strategic process points: Strategic notifications are made to the clients about the follow up of their acquisitions via electronic means.
- Adequate tracking of quotes and sales: The system provides support to the advisors to properly follow up on their quotes and sales, effectively replying to the client.
