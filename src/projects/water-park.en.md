Due to the necessity of being able to manage visits acquisition and other activities at Las Cañadas campsite and aquatic park, we developed an ecommerce site, a platform that solves this and other of the company’s fundamental needs.

We developed a console that facilitates the management of the client’s information. It generates all sorts of reports that help manage the campsite’s daily operation. From the console, information is managed  for the operation of the ecommerce by managing prices, events, promotions, content and restrictions. It manages reservations, availability, and the cash registers to operate the admissions system.

We developed an admission system that controls the visitors' entrances. Besides being able to acquire visits and activities through the same system, it also allows the use of the Canopy tour activities.

All of this was created as an ecosystem of applications that communicate between themselves to fulfill all the client’s needs.

In addition to this, the console has an admissions dashboard with indicators of all the revenue obtained during the day, number of people in the campsite, number of people about to enter, as well as the visitors’ origin displayed in a graph.

We also created another dashboard for the Canopy tour, that shows the number of selled tickets, indicators of the revenue obtained during the day by activity, the number of people that used the activity, and the visitors’ origin explained visually.

This system offers a report of the current year’s data compared to previous years for use by general management.
