We developed a platform that allows people who have been injured to contact their attorneys through an application that lets both their attorneys and health care providers to communicate among themselves and to have a better communication, reducing communication costs during the duration of the trial. The project was divided into 3 phases:

- First phase: A Discovery project was done to understand the project scope and limitations in order to avoid working on unnecessary requirements.
- Second phase: A responsive application is developed to be used by the users on any device, this way we avoid long and consecutive updates.
- Third phase: The need for user manuals and long and exhausting training was eliminated, alpha users  were added during the prototype phase, and beta users during the projectâ€™s pilot phase.
